# Python-Random-Imgur-Downloader

A simple program that randomizes an imgur link and downloaded the image in binary format. Then saves it and analyzes based on hexdecimal via imghdr to find filetype. 

This program depends on random, urllib, imghdr, string, and os.

When running you are prompted to select the name of the directory that the program was started in.
Then you will be prompted to select the batch size. (Must be an integer for obvious reasons)

Functionality is only for 5 character imgur pictures, but the feature will be added to do 6 character (provides much slower results)
